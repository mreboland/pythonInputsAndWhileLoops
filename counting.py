# While loops
# The for loop takes a collection of items and executes a block of code once for each item in the collection. A while loop runs as long as, or while, a certain condition is true.
# An example of counting to 5:
# We set a counter, currentNumber to 1 to have a start for our count
currentNumber = 1

# While currentNumber is less than or equal to 5 this will loop until it hits 5
while currentNumber <= 5:
    # Print the number
    print(currentNumber)
    # Increase currentNumber by 1 to increase the count. It's the same as currentNumber = currentNumber + 1
    currentNumber += 1
